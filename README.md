🔍 Key Insights & Findings

Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset led to the following key insights:

[Insight 1]: A high-potential "Low-Income Premium" customer segment was identified, demonstrating that customer value is not solely tied to income.[1]

[Insight 2]: Customer satisfaction ratings and negative feedback are frequently correlated with operational issues like shipping delays, rather than inherent product quality.[1]

[Insight 3]: A significant operational bottleneck exists in the order fulfillment pipeline, where a large number of orders remain in a "Processing" or "Pending" status, undermining the customer experience.

For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to our full analysis in the Jupyter Notebook and the accompanying presentation.
